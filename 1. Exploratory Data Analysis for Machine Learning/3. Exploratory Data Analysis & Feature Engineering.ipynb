It's an approach where you analyze datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.  Think of it as the \"getting to know you\" phase with your data.\n","\n","The **primary goals** of EDA are:\n","\n","  * To determine if the data makes sense in the context of the problem.\n","  * To identify if further data cleaning or preprocessing is necessary.\n","  * To assess if more data needs to be collected.\n","  * To uncover underlying structures, patterns, anomalies (like outliers), and relationships within the data.  These initial findings can sometimes be even more insightful than the results from formal modeling.\n","\n","EDA employs a combination of **statistical techniques** and **visual techniques**.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cdQrMrx1A5MK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["  * **Statistical techniques** involve calculating summary statistics. These include measures of central tendency (like mean, median, mode), measures of spread (like standard deviation, variance, range, interquartile range), and measures of shape (like skewness and kurtosis).  Correlation analysis between different variables is also a key statistical technique.\n","  * **Visual techniques** involve creating plots and graphs to understand data distributions, relationships between variables, and identify outliers.  Common visualizations include:\n","      * **Histograms:** To see the frequency distribution of a single numerical variable.\n","      * **Scatter plots:** To examine the relationship or correlation between two numerical variables.\n","      * **Box plots:** To visualize the distribution of numerical data through quartiles, identify potential outliers, and compare distributions across different categories.\n","      * **Bar charts:** To compare quantities across different categories.\n","      * **Line plots:** To visualize trends over time or an ordered sequence.\n","      * **Heatmaps:** To visualize the magnitude of a phenomenon in 2D, often used for correlation matrices.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"b_lveTf_5ybd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**Python Libraries for EDA:**\n","\n","  * **Pandas:** Essential for data manipulation, loading data, and calculating summary statistics.\n","  * **NumPy:** Fundamental for numerical computations, often used alongside Pandas.\n","  * **Matplotlib:** A foundational library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  Pandas plotting functions are often wrappers around Matplotlib, offering convenience but sometimes less flexibility.\n","  * **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.  It simplifies the creation of complex visualizations.\n","\n","**Sampling Data:**\n","For very large datasets, looking at a sample of the data is a practical part of EDA to get a quick understanding without processing the entire dataset.\n","\n","  * **Random sampling:** Involves selecting a subset of rows randomly.\n","  * **Stratified sampling:** Useful when you need to ensure that the proportions of different categories in your outcome variable (or any key categorical variable) are maintained in the sample.

Explain the difference between random sampling and stratified sampling.**\n","\\* **Solution:**\n","\\* **Random sampling:** Each data point has an equal chance of being selected. It might not preserve the proportions of subgroups within the data, especially if some subgroups are small.\n","\\* **Stratified sampling:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata), and random samples are taken from each stratum, typically in proportion to the stratum's size in the overall population. This ensures that all subgroups are adequately represented in the sample, which is crucial for imbalanced datasets.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**22. What is a pair plot in Seaborn, and what kind of information does it visualize?**\n","\\* **Solution:** A pair plot (e.g., `sns.pairplot()`) creates a matrix of plots showing pairwise relationships between several numerical variables in a dataset. For each pair of variables, it typically shows a scatter plot. It also usually shows the distribution of each individual variable along the diagonal.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**23. In a Seaborn pair plot, what is typically shown along the diagonal, and why?**\n","\\* **Solution:** Along the diagonal, a histogram or a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot of each individual variable is typically shown. This is because a scatter plot of a variable against itself would just be a straight line and wouldn't provide information about its distribution.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**24. What does the `hue` argument in a Seaborn pair plot or other plots like box plots allow you to do?**\n","\\* **Solution:** The `hue` argument allows you to introduce a third, categorical variable into the plot.

What is a Hexbin plot (e.g., using `sns.jointplot` with `kind='hex'`), and what does it show in addition to a scatter plot?**\n","\\* **Solution:** A Hexbin plot is used for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables, especially when there are many data points (dense scatter plot). It divides the plotting area into hexagonal bins and colors each bin based on the number of data points it contains.

Why is feature engineering an important step before training machine learning models?**\n","\\* **Solution:** Feature engineering is important because it aims to create more relevant and informative input features from the existing data, which can significantly improve the performance, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning models. Well-engineered features can help models learn patterns more effectively.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**27. Name at least three common types of variable modifications discussed in feature engineering.**\n","\\* **Solution:**\n","1\\.  Log Transformation (and other power transformations)\n","2\\.  Categorical Variable Encoding (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding)\n","3\\.  Feature Scaling (e.g., Standard Scaling, Min-Max Scaling)\n","4\\.  Creating Polynomial Features / Interaction Terms\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**28. What assumption of linear regression models can variable transformations help meet?**\n","\\* **Solution:** Variable transformations can help meet the assumption of a **linear relationship** between the independent variables and the dependent variable. They can also help stabilize variance (homoscedasticity) and normalize residuals.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**29. When is a log transformation (like `np.log1p`) particularly useful for a numerical feature?**\n","\\* **Solution:** A log transformation is particularly useful when a numerical feature is highly skewed (e.g., right-skewed), or when the relationship between variables is multiplicative rather than additive, or when effects show diminishing returns. It can help make the distribution more symmetric and closer to normal.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**30. Why would you use `np.log1p(x)` instead of `np.log(x)`?**\n","\\* **Solution:** You would use `np.log1p(x)` (which calculates `log(1+x)`) instead of `np.log(x)` to handle cases where `x` can be zero. `np.log(0)` is undefined (negative infinity), which can cause issues in calculations, while `np.log1p(0)` evaluates to `log(1) = 0`, providing a numerically stable way to transform data that includes zeros.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**31. What is the purpose of creating polynomial features?**\n","\\* **Solution:** The purpose of creating polynomial features (e.g., $x^2$, $x^3$) is to allow machine learning models, especially linear models, to capture non-linear relationships in the data.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**32. Besides powers of a single feature (e.g., x²), what other type of terms can scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures` generate by default?**\n","\\* **Solution:** By default, scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures` can also generate **interaction terms**, which are products of different features (e.g., $x\\_1 \\\\cdot x\\_2$).\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**33. Why must non-numeric features like categorical variables be encoded before being used in most machine learning models?**\n","\\* **Solution:** Most machine learning algorithms are based on mathematical equations and operations (e.g., distance calculations, matrix operations) that require numerical input. Non-numeric features cannot be directly processed by these algorithms.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**34. Explain the difference between nominal and ordinal categorical data.**\n","\\* **Solution:**\n","\\* **Nominal categorical data:** Categories do not have an intrinsic order or ranking (e.g., colors like \"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"; city names).\n","\\* **Ordinal categorical data:** Categories have a meaningful order or ranking, but the magnitude of difference between categories may not be consistent or known (e.g., education levels like \"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\"; satisfaction ratings like \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\").\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**35. What is Binary Encoding suitable for?**\n","\\* **Solution:** Binary Encoding is suitable for categorical features that have exactly two distinct values (e.g., \"Yes\"/\"No\", \"True\"/\"False\", \"Male\"/\"Female\"). It typically converts these into 0 and 1.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**36. Describe how One-Hot Encoding works for a nominal categorical variable with multiple unique values.**\n","\\* **Solution:** One-Hot Encoding transforms a nominal categorical variable with `k` unique values into `k` new binary (0 or 1) features. For each original data point, the new feature corresponding to its category will have a value of 1, and all other `k-1` new features will have a value of 0.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**37. Which pandas function is commonly used for One-Hot Encoding?**\n","\\* **Solution:** `pd.get_dummies()`\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**38. How does Ordinal Encoding typically represent ordered categories numerically?**\n","\\* **Solution:** Ordinal Encoding typically assigns a unique integer to each category based on its inherent order or rank. For example, \"Low\" might be 1, \"Medium\" 2, and \"High\" 3.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**39. What is a potential drawback of using Ordinal Encoding?**\n","\\* **Solution:** A potential drawback is that the assigned numerical values might imply an equidistant relationship or a specific magnitude of difference between categories that doesn't actually exist in the data (e.g., the difference between \"Medium\" (2) and \"Low\" (1) is the same as between \"High\" (3) and \"Medium\" (2), which may not be true). This can mislead some models.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**40. Why is Feature Scaling important, especially for algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors or SVMs?**\n","\\* **Solution:** Feature Scaling is important because many algorithms, particularly those that rely on distance calculations (like K-Nearest Neighbors, SVMs, K-Means) or gradient descent (like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks), are sensitive to the scale of input features. Features with larger values can disproportionately influence the results, leading to suboptimal model performance.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**41. Explain how Standard Scaling transforms the data.**\n","\\* **Solution:** Standard Scaling (or Z-score normalization) transforms the data by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the standard deviation for each feature. This results in features that have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula is: $z = (x - \\\\mu) / \\\\sigma$.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**42. Explain how Min-Max Scaling transforms the data.**\n","\\* **Solution:** Min-Max Scaling rescales the data to fit within a specific bounded range, typically 0 to 1 (or sometimes -1 to 1). It does this by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and then dividing by the range (maximum value minus minimum value) of the feature. The formula for scaling to [0, 1] is: $x\\_{scaled} = (x - x\\_{min}) / (x\\_{max} - x\\_{min})$.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**43. What is a major disadvantage of Min-Max Scaling, particularly when compared to Robust Scaling?**\n","\\* **Solution:** A major disadvantage of Min-Max Scaling is its sensitivity to outliers (extreme values). Outliers can significantly affect the minimum and maximum values, thereby compressing the rest of the data into a smaller range and distorting the relative relationships between other data points.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**44. What is the main advantage of Robust Scaling?**\n","\\* **Solution:** The main advantage of Robust Scaling is that it uses statistics that are less influenced by outliers, such as the median and the interquartile range (IQR). This makes it more \"robust\" to the presence of extreme values in the data compared to Standard Scaling or Min-Max Scaling.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**45. Which Python library provides tools for standard scaling, min-max scaling, and robust scaling?**\n","\\* **Solution:** The `scikit-learn` library, specifically its `sklearn.preprocessing` module (e.g., `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `RobustScaler`).\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**46. In the context of scikit-learn transformers (like scalers or `PolynomialFeatures`), what is the purpose of the `.fit()` method?**\n","\\* **Solution:** The purpose of the `.fit()` method is to compute the necessary parameters from the training data that the transformer will use for the actual transformation. For example, a scaler would learn the mean and standard deviation (for `StandardScaler`) or min and max (for `MinMaxScaler`) from the data during the `fit` step.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**47. What is the purpose of the `.transform()` method on a scikit-learn transformer object after it has been fitted?**\n","\\* **Solution:** The purpose of the `.transform()` method is to apply the learned transformation (using the parameters computed by `.fit()`) to the data. It takes the input data and returns the transformed version of that data.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**48. What is an \"interaction term\" in feature engineering (e.g., from `PolynomialFeatures`), and what does it aim to capture?**\n","\\* **Solution:** An interaction term is a feature created by multiplying two or more original features together (e.g., feature A \\* feature B). It aims to capture the combined effect of these features, where the influence of one feature on the target variable might depend on the value of another feature.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**49. Explain the concept of creating a feature that captures \"deviation relative to category mean.\"**\n","\\* **Solution:** This involves calculating the mean of a numerical feature for each category of a categorical variable. Then, for each data point, a new feature is created by subtracting the mean of its respective category from its actual value of the numerical feature. This new feature measures how much an individual data point's value deviates from the average within its own group.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","**50. Which pandas method, used with `.groupby()`, is suitable for creating new features based on group-wise calculations (like mean or standard deviation) while maintaining the original DataFrame's size and index?**\n","\\* **Solution:** The `.transform()` method, when used with `.groupby()`, is suitable for this. It performs a group-wise calculation (e.g., calculating the mean for each group) and then broadcasts the results back to align with the original DataFrame's index, making it easy to create new columns based on these group aggregates.\n","\n","-----\n"],"metadata":{"id":"lzqKvs3fPll9"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
